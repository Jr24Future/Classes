Instead of following a tutorial line for line, I watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91a7ceECNTc&ab_channel=MobileiGames make a snake game.
I tried to see what he did and how it affected what. I found out a better way to make a window than the tutorials I followed in 2/21/23

Next time, I'll try to keep focused on the tutorial, I didn't have enough time to complete it today (I had to tend to other work).

I see no apparent major issues.

So I abandoned the snake game and followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8Qiz9Bn1Ag&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge
Shows you how to make a windo with little typing.

I'll be focused on this tutorial for now.

Unless the drag and drop design method is severely limiting, I see no apparent issues

I added a square that you can move with WASD keys

I will try to add projectiles

It's hard to understand the code as I follow the tutorials (they don't really teach)
